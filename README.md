  <summary>What is Speckle?</summary>

Speckle is the Open Source Data Platform for AEC. Speckle allows you to say goodbye to files: we give you object-level control of what you share, infinite versioning history & changelogs. Read more on [our website](https://speckle.systems).

## Introduction

This repo is the home to our Speckle 2.0 PowerBI project. The [Speckle Server](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server) is providing all the web-facing functionality and can be found [here](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server).

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Install

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-powerbi/releases) page, downlad the `.mez` file of the latest release and copy it into the following folder in your computer:

```
YOUR_USER_FOLDER\Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors\
```

Now open PowerBI and you should see `Speckle (beta)` appear in the data source.

## Usage

> More detailed instructions on how to use the connector will be added shortly!

## Developing & Debugging

We encourage everyone interested to debug / hack / contribute / give feedback to this project.

### Setup

#### Install PowerQuery SDK

Follow the instructions from the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/installingsdk)

#### Build with Visual Studio

Every time you build the connector, VisualStudio will copy the latest `.mez` connector file to the appropriate location. Just restart PowerBI to see the latest changes.

#### Debug

You can start the PowerQuery connector in VisualStudio, this will open a standalone connector you can use for testing purposes.

We don't know of a way to debug the connector live in PowerBI, but we'd be happy to hear about it.
